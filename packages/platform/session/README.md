# @munaxa/session

> Sessions as first-class, revocable, device-bound objects.

Session lifecycle: creation, idle and absolute timeouts, concurrency limits, device management, trusted devices and revocation.

Part of the [Munaxa shared security platform](../../../docs/security-platform/README.md). This package
contains no product-specific logic and depends on no Munaxa application.

## Install

// package.json

  "@munaxa/session": "workspace:^"

## Guarantees

- **Deployment and cloud agnostic** — Node built-ins only; every external capability arrives
  through a port from `@munaxa/interfaces`.
- **Multi-tenant** — every entry point takes, or derives, a `TenantId`.
- **Secure by default** — the zero-argument configuration is the hardened one.
- **Backward compatible** — see the compatibility tests in `test/compat.test.ts`.
