# @munaxa/rbac

> Deny-by-default authorization with a resolver you can reason about.

Roles, permissions, claims, role hierarchy, the permission resolver, the policy engine and the authorization guards and middleware built on them.

Part of the [Munaxa shared security platform](../../../docs/security-platform/README.md). This package
contains no product-specific logic and depends on no Munaxa application.

## Guarantees

- **Deployment and cloud agnostic** — Node built-ins only; every external capability arrives
  through a port from `@munaxa/interfaces`.
- **Multi-tenant** — every entry point takes, or derives, a `TenantId`.
- **Secure by default** — the zero-argument configuration is the hardened one.
- **Backward compatible** — see the compatibility tests in `test/compat.test.ts`.
