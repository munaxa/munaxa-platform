# @munaxa/logging

> Structured logs with a correlation id attached to every line.

Structured, redacting, correlation-aware logging for application, security and performance events.

Part of the [Munaxa shared security platform](../../../docs/security-platform/README.md). This package
contains no product-specific logic and depends on no Munaxa application.

## Install

```jsonc
// package.json
"dependencies": {
  "@munaxa/logging": "workspace:^"
}
```

## Guarantees

- **Deployment and cloud agnostic** — Node built-ins only; every external capability arrives
  through a port from `@munaxa/interfaces`.
- **Multi-tenant** — every entry point takes, or derives, a `TenantId`.
- **Secure by default** — the zero-argument configuration is the hardened one.
- **Backward compatible** — see the compatibility tests in `test/compat.test.ts`.
